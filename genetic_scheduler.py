#
# Issues:
# - Online classes have no room, now to deal with
# - T dict assumes all rooms are available for all time slots, might need
#   a mechanism to block out rooms at certain days/times
# - EE 188 gets capacity of 90 from Sample, but try to assign to 069-224
# - need to kill solutions where time slots don't match minimum/maximum units,
#   and perhaps add some preference for standard time slots?
# - For new instructors not in the sample, have to add their info into
#   InstructorConstraints.csv.
# - Speed issues, can be more efficient during random_solution_generation,
#   some things are happening redundantly.
#
# Questions:
# - strip() not working, and why whitespace in the first place
# - instructor workload/days taught: if we add this to fitness, then I
#   think the program will simply take away courses to teach unless all of
#   the instructor/course assignments are made. Are they pretty much always
#   going to be made by constraint?
# - Do we have fixed rooms/schedules - labs, etc where the place/time fixed?
# - Or how about where the room is blacked out?
# - Presentation of "Top solution preservation"
# - What's with the Th_14:20_17:40 overlapping Th_17:30_20:00?? Hacked that
#   in the sample solutions spreadsheet. Made them all Th_14:20_16:50, which
#   does exist for Tuesday.
#
# Scratchpad:
# - crossover, compare technique where parents breed exclusively vs non-excl.
# - return if avg fitness starts to drop?
# - Should have done this purely OO, with objects for everything, especially
#   solutions, then solution class could have it's own methods and make
#   the code more organized

        creates GD['F'] dict with the number of the solution as the key

        the solutions based on fitness later

        Scratch pad of ideas
        --------------------
        Fitness parameter hash details (could have multiple ways to configure)
        - professor proximity of chosen room to department
        - course proximity of chosen room to department
        - what days professor teaches
        - penalty for time of day, but a light penalty
        - class/prereq
        - class/coreg
        - wasted capacity in rooms

        - degree progression (need 2 spreadsheets that don't exist)
          first one has class/prereq (this means you can teach)
          another one has class/coreq
        - number of classes taught by professor (hard constraint)
        - no room/date/time/instructor conflicts (depends on how detailed
          the solution generator is)
        - professor workload (like how many people a class has,
          how many courses professor teaches, etc)

        Other ideas:
        - departure from a previous schedule/solution?
        - TODO - keep track of penalty metrics, a way to tell the user which
          penalties are being imposed the most? Might help tailor constraints
          with that info
