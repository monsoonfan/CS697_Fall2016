#
# Issues:
# - Online classes have no room, now to deal with
# - T dict assumes all rooms are available for all time slots, might need
#   a mechanism to block out rooms at certain days/times
# - EE 188 gets capacity of 90 from Sample, but try to assign to 069-224
#
# Questions:
# - strip() not working, and why whitespace in the first place
# - instructor workload/days taught: if we add this to fitness, then I
#   think the program will simply take away courses to teach unless all of
#   the instructor/course assignments are made. Are they pretty much always
#   going to be made by constraint?
# - Do we have fixed rooms/schedules - labs, etc where the place/time fixed?
# - Or how about where the room is blacked out?
#
# Scratchpad:
# - want time conversion functions from the same standalone engine:
#   - list of equivalent time slots for a given time slot
#   - numerical time for a given 24hr time

        Fitness parameter hash details (could have multiple ways to configure)
        - professor proximity of chosen room to department
        - course proximity of chosen room to department
        - what days professor teaches
        - penalty for time of day, but a light penalty
        - class/prereq
        - class/coreg
        - wasted capacity in rooms

        - degree progression (need 2 spreadsheets that don't exist)
          first one has class/prereq (this means you can teach)
          another one has class/coreq
        - number of classes taught by professor (hard constraint)
        - no room/date/time/instructor conflicts (depends on how detailed
          the solution generator is)
        - professor workload (like how many people a class has,
          how many courses professor teaches, etc)

        Other ideas:
        - departure from a previous schedule/solution?
        - TODO - keep track of penalty metrics, a way to tell the user which
          penalties are being imposed the most? Might help tailor constraints
